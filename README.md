# Library Management System (LMS)

## Project Overview

The Library Management System (LMS) is designed to manage the operations of a library, including book management, patron management, and transaction processing for borrowing and returning books. The intended audience is the librarian. The system will be built using Java and will utilize a MySQL database for data storage.

## Functional Requirements

### 2.1 Book Management

#### Add Book
- The system should allow librarians to add new books to the libraryâ€™s collection.
- Required fields: Title, Author, ISBN.
- Availability of an added book is set to true by default.

#### Remove Book
- The system should allow librarians to remove books from the collection.
- A book cannot be removed if there are pending transactions associated with it.

#### Update Book Availability
- The system should allow updating the availability status of books (True for available and false for unavailable).

#### View All Books
- The system should display a list of all books, including their details and availability status.

### 2.2 Patron Management

#### Add Patron
- The system should allow adding new patrons to the library.
- Required fields: Name, Email.

#### Remove Patron
- The system should allow removing patrons from the library.
- A patron cannot be removed if there are pending transactions associated with them.

#### View All Patrons
- The system should display a list of all patrons, including their details.

### 2.3 Transaction Management

#### Borrow Book
- Patrons should be able to borrow available books.
- Required fields: Book Name, Patron Name, Date Borrowed, Date Due.

#### Return Book
- Patrons should be able to return borrowed books.
- The system should update the transaction with the return date.

#### View Transaction History
- The system should display a list of all transactions, including book title, patron name, date borrowed, date due, and date returned.

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Usability
- The system should have a user-friendly interface that is easy to navigate for librarians.

### Reliability
- The system should be reliable and handle errors gracefully, ensuring data integrity.

## Technical Requirements

- **Programming Language**: Java
- **Database**: MySQL
- **Frameworks and Libraries**:
  - JavaFX for the user interface
  - JDBC for database connectivity
